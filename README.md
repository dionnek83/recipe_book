## Add a recipe

There are 3 steps to add a recipe which are the following:

- Basics which requires information such as the recipe name, meal type, description etc.
- Ingredients and once an ingredient is entered it is displayed at the bottom of the page. The image for the recipe is also required in this section.
- Instructions which takes in the procedures for the recipe and has the same functionality as the ingredients page.

Once all the fields are entered the recipe is pushed to Firebase.
